Individual Assignment

Shell Programming


Background
A Linux-based software tool is required to allow a local company to keep track of all of its
business contacts. The owner is particularly interested in keeping track of each business name, contact
personâ€™s full name, address, mobile number, and email address.

Based upon the above information the owner would like to be able to search for particular
business entries, add new business contacts and remove old contacts from their own
system.

This tool should also provide the user with the ability to e-mail
      (1) any
      (2) all of the contacts listed in the address book with details of upcoming sales or discount offers etc.


Assignment

Develop a "menu driven" shell program that will allow the user to interactively update (i.e.
add, remove), search and list all their business contacts information, which is stored locally
in a file called BusinessDetails.
